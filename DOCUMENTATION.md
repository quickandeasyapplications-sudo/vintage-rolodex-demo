## Installation

To set up the Vintage Rolodex application locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd vintage-rolodex
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    The project uses `pnpm` as its package manager. If you don't have `pnpm` installed, you can install it via npm:
    ```bash
    npm install -g pnpm
    ```
    Then, install the project dependencies:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```
    The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5175/` (or another port if 5175 is in use).

## Implemented Enhancements

This section details the enhancements implemented in the Vintage Rolodex application.

### Multi-Field Search and Tag Filtering

**Description:** The search functionality has been significantly improved to allow comprehensive searching across multiple contact fields. Additionally, a dynamic tag filtering system has been introduced, enabling users to quickly filter contacts by their associated tags.

**Details:**
*   **Multi-Field Search:** The search bar now queries contact data across first name, last name, email, phone, WhatsApp, notes, and tags, providing a more robust and flexible search experience.
*   **Tag Filtering Interface:** A dedicated section displays all unique tags present in the contacts. Users can click on tags to toggle their selection, filtering the displayed contacts to only those possessing the selected tags. A clear all button is provided to reset tag filters.

### Enhanced Sound Effects and Refined Animations

**Description:** The application's auditory and visual feedback has been upgraded to provide a more immersive and nostalgic user experience.

**Details:**
*   **Enhanced Sound Effects:** The existing page-flip and click sounds have been refined to be more evocative of vintage machinery. New sound effects have been added for key interactions such as saving a contact (an ascending tone) and deleting a contact (a descending tone), providing clearer audio cues.
*   **Refined Animations:** Subtle animations have been introduced for UI elements, including smooth transitions for cards and buttons, and a pulsing effect for the floating action button, enhancing the overall visual appeal and responsiveness.

### Robust Import/Export Functionality

**Description:** The application now supports various formats for importing and exporting contact data, improving data portability and backup options.

**Details:**
*   **Export Options:** Users can now export their contact list in three formats:
    *   **JSON:** For programmatic use and easy data transfer.
    *   **CSV:** A common format compatible with spreadsheet applications.
    *   **vCard (.vcf):** A standard format for electronic business cards, compatible with most contact management systems.
*   **Import CSV:** Users can import contacts from a CSV file, allowing for easy migration of existing contact lists into the Rolodex application.

## Updated Enhancement Recommendations

While significant progress has been made, further enhancements can elevate the application's functionality and user experience. The following recommendations are prioritized based on impact and feasibility:

### Advanced UI/UX Improvements

*   **Drag-and-Drop Reordering:** Allow users to reorder contacts within their filtered or searched lists, providing more personalized organization.
*   **Customizable Themes:** Introduce additional vintage-inspired themes (e.g., sepia, monochrome) to cater to diverse aesthetic preferences.
*   **Responsive Design Refinement:** Further optimize the layout and element sizing for a seamless experience across a wider range of screen sizes and orientations.

### Enhanced Contact Management

*   **Contact Grouping:** Implement functionality to group contacts into custom categories beyond simple tags (e.g., Family, Colleagues, Clients).
*   **Birthday/Anniversary Reminders:** Integrate a simple reminder system for important dates associated with contacts.
*   **Image Upload for Contacts:** Allow users to attach profile pictures or other relevant images to contact cards.

### Integration and Data Synchronization

*   **Cloud Synchronization:** Explore options for secure cloud synchronization (e.g., Google Contacts, iCloud, or a custom backend) to ensure data persistence and accessibility across devices.
*   **PWA Enhancements:** Fully leverage Progressive Web App capabilities for a more native-like experience, including advanced offline support and push notifications.

### Search and Accessibility

*   **Voice Search:** Implement voice recognition for hands-free searching of contacts.
*   **Accessibility Audit:** Conduct a thorough accessibility audit to ensure the application is usable by individuals with disabilities, adhering to WCAG guidelines.

### Performance Optimization

*   **Lazy Loading:** For very large contact lists, implement lazy loading of contact cards to improve initial load times and overall performance.
*   **IndexedDB for Large Datasets:** For extremely large local datasets, consider using IndexedDB for more efficient storage and retrieval compared to localStorage.

These recommendations aim to build upon the current enhancements, transforming the Vintage Rolodex into an even more powerful, user-friendly, and feature-rich contact management solution.
