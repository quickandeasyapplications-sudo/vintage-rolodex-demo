## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your computer:

- **Git:** Download from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)
- **Node.js and npm:** Download from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- **A GitHub Account:** Create one at [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) if you don't already have one

### Verify Installation

Open your terminal/command prompt and run these commands to verify installation:

```bash
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

All three should return version numbers.

---

## Step 1: Prepare Your GitHub Account

1. **Log in to GitHub:** Go to [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) and log in to your account.
2. **Note your username:** You'll need this for the deployment URL. Your username appears in the top-right corner of the GitHub interface.

---

## Step 2: Create a New Repository

1. **Click the "+" icon** in the top-right corner of GitHub and select **"New repository"**.
2. **Fill in the repository details:**
   - **Repository name:** `vintage-rolodex-demo`
   - **Description:** "A nostalgic digital contact manager with vintage aesthetics"
   - **Visibility:** Select **Public** (required for GitHub Pages free tier)
   - **Initialize this repository with:** Leave unchecked for now
3. **Click "Create repository"**

You'll be taken to your new empty repository page. Keep this page open for reference.

---

## Step 3: Clone and Prepare the Application

### 3.1 Extract the Application Files

1. **Extract the `vintage-rolodex-enhanced.zip` file** to a folder on your computer (e.g., `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\` on Windows or `~/Documents/` on macOS/Linux).
2. **Navigate to the extracted folder** in your terminal/command prompt:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/vintage-rolodex
   ```

### 3.2 Initialize Git Repository

1. **Initialize Git in the project directory:**
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. **Add all files to Git:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

3. **Create an initial commit:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Vintage Rolodex application"
   ```

### 3.3 Install Dependencies

1. **Install npm packages:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This may take a few minutes as it downloads all required dependencies.

---

## Step 4: Configure for GitHub Pages

The application has already been configured with the base path `/vintage-rolodex-demo/` in the `vite.config.js` file. However, you should verify this configuration:

1. **Open `vite.config.js`** in a text editor
2. **Verify the base path is set:**
   ```javascript
   export default defineConfig({
     base: '/vintage-rolodex-demo/',
     // ... rest of configuration
   })
   ```

If the base path is different or missing, update it to match your repository name.

---

## Step 5: Push to GitHub

### 5.1 Add Remote Repository

1. **Go back to your GitHub repository page** (the one you created in Step 2)
2. **Copy the HTTPS URL** (it should look like `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vintage-rolodex-demo.git`)
3. **In your terminal, add the remote:**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vintage-rolodex-demo.git
   ```
   Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

### 5.2 Rename Branch (if needed)

If you're using an older version of Git, you might need to rename the branch from `master` to `main`:

```bash
git branch -M main
```

### 5.3 Push to GitHub

1. **Push your code to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   This may prompt you to authenticate. Follow GitHub's authentication instructions (you may need to create a Personal Access Token).

2. **Wait for the push to complete.** You should see output indicating files have been pushed.

3. **Refresh your GitHub repository page** to confirm all files are now visible on GitHub.

---

## Step 6: Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Go to your repository on GitHub** (`https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vintage-rolodex-demo`)
2. **Click the "Settings" tab** at the top of the repository
3. **In the left sidebar, click "Pages"**
4. **Under "Build and deployment":**
   - **Source:** Select **"Deploy from a branch"**
   - **Branch:** Select **"main"** and **"/ (root)"**
5. **Click "Save"**

GitHub will now automatically build and deploy your application. This process may take a few minutes.

---

## Step 7: Access Your Live Demo

1. **Wait 2-5 minutes** for GitHub Pages to build and deploy your application
2. **Visit your live demo URL:**
   ```
   https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/vintage-rolodex-demo/
   ```
   Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

3. **Your Vintage Rolodex application should now be live!** You can share this URL with anyone to showcase your application.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Page shows 404 error

**Solution:**
- Verify the base path in `vite.config.js` matches your repository name
- Ensure you've pushed the code to the `main` branch
- Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
- Wait a few more minutes for GitHub to finish building

### Issue: Blank page or styling looks broken

**Solution:**
- Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12)
- Check the Console tab for any error messages
- Verify the base path in `vite.config.js` is correct
- Clear your browser cache and refresh the page

### Issue: Changes aren't appearing on the live site

**Solution:**
- Make sure you've committed and pushed your changes:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Your commit message"
  git push
  ```
- Wait a few minutes for GitHub Pages to rebuild
- Clear your browser cache and do a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

### Issue: Authentication error when pushing to GitHub

**Solution:**
- Create a Personal Access Token:
  1. Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens
  2. Click "Generate new token"
  3. Select `repo` scope
  4. Copy the token and use it as your password when pushing
- Or use SSH keys for authentication (see GitHub's SSH setup guide)
